ESPECIALLY, MEDICAL PROCEDURES WITH KNOWN RISKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!! YOU THINK \"ANTI-VAXXERS\" LACK EDUCATION, HOW BANNING THEIR KIDS FROM SCHOOLS HELPS TO IMPROVE EDUCATION?? WHAT'S THE NEXT STEP? SEGRAGATION? POLICE-ENFORCED MEDICAL INTERVENTIONS WITHOUT CONSENT FOR CHILDREN AND ADULTS? I'm NOT AGAINST VACCINES. I'm AGAINST MASS HYSTERIA which is obvious on both sides. I'm AGAINST BANNING KIDS FROM SCHOOLS unless there are current outbreaks and significant evidence of under-vaccinated kids spreading the disease.I'm FOR INFORMED CONSENT FOR ANY MEDICAL PROCEDURE, no matter how small the risk is. Vaccine history has some ugly moments and science behind vaccines is complicated. It's not about Autism which everyone is so stuck on. There is still a bunch of unanswered questions. There is no need to demonize anyone -- both sides have VALID CONCERNS. Let's all keep our minds open. WE ALL HAVE A LOT TO LEARN!!! Banning kids from schools is VIOLATION OF BASIC HUMAN RIGHTS!!! <This post is edited in an effort to make my message heard. The original text is following> Just don't ever read vaccine inserts, especially the part about possible adverse reactions. Don't worry that doctors don't do any tests to check if your particular baby is allergic to any ingredient in the vaccine (as long as average numbers look OK). Don't worry that neither the doctor nor the vaccine manufacturer are liable for any adverse reaction. Don't ever look at vaccine recall history. Don't ever read about cases compensated by the Vaccine Court (they compensate a small percentage of applicants and many don't apply). Don't wonder how gov't-imposed mandatory vaccination impacts pharm-companies' motivation to produce safer vaccines, develop tests to detect possible allergic reactions or to do more safety research (on immediate and long-term effects). Don't try to compare the actual numbers of kids suffering adverse reactions to vaccines with numbers of kids who suffered in any way because of people who don't feel comfortable vaccinating knowing what they know or knowing personally someone who got injured (in the present in any given part of the world). Don't think that demonizing undervaxxinating parents and banning their kids from public and private schools (CA SB277) is more evil and dangerous than the the danger these kids really present. Don't worry that recent outbreaks in CA show that majority getting infected are the adults and ppl whose vaccines wore off or never produced immunity. Don't think what the next step will be. (Police force-vaccinating anyone without consent?) How far are you willing to go and what are you willing to support? At what cost?\n",
      "P.S. What do we think about gov't-enforced mandatory circumcision? :) How many believe it will help prevent diseases and make your kids' future adult lives safer?

      "Those of us who are called \"anti-vaxxers\" were once pro vaccine. We vaccinated our kids, they developed seizures, allergies, asthma, autism, some died. We learned the hard way. You don't have to. I think safe vaccines should be available. There are no independent, double blind, placebo tests done on vaccines. CDC scientist, William Thompson says there was a forty percent increase in autism following the MMR vaccine and they covered it up. So, eithera Senior Scientist for the CDC is making up stories or vaccines really are triggering autism. Either way, it brings their safety in to question. \n",

      "comment:  I have been reading through these comments...Why bash the antivaxxers? Vaccines are a pharmaceutical. The baby has a new immune system and the blood brain barrier has not formed. I don't think it's controversial. It's pretty simple. A pharmaceutical carries risks. If you wanna vaccinate then great. But get the full story on what it does to your immune system to be \"tricked\" so early in life. Ask yourself if you have a strong family history of autoimmune disorders. Know that it gives an immune system extra jobs which may lead to less ability to fight off other ailments. Allergies and asthma are more prevalent. I can respect that people will have varying opinions. We all care about our kids. Growing up, my mom's best friend had a perfectly healthy daughter. She received MMR and had a grand mal seizure and suffered brain damage. Her dr diagnosed her with vaccine injury. She was left unable to talk or walk for the rest of her life. So that was MY first personal experience with vaccines. Bottom line...A pharmaceutical that carries at least a risk of harm to some, should never be mandated. Because, in the end, no one seems to care about the \"sacrifices\" made for the \"common good.\" \n",
